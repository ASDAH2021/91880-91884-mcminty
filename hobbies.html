    <header>
     <p>Growing up, I always listened to music. I've always had a passion for music because it would help me when I feel down. I have a lot of family members who have talent in music. I hope to master all instruments. My favorite instrument is the piano because there are so many things you can do on it. There are so many song styles to play. My favorite song style to play on the piano is blues, Latin, rocknroll, and gospel. I hope to pursue a career in playing the piano.</p>

   <!--This explains my second hobbie-->
   <div class="sectionTwo"><p>I've always had a heart for rugby league and it was one of my biggest dreams as a kid to make it to NRL in front of a big crowd. Rugby league would also help me because it would help me physically and mentally. For me, rugby was a place I could be myself and train until I'm out of it. My family is the biggest supporter when it and hope that I make the NRL.</div><!--sectionTwo-->
