     <p>Hi, My name is Monty and I am 18 years of age. This picture next to me is me in the military. I had dropped out of school to join the military so that I could fight for my country. I have been recruited into the military when i was 15 and been training since. I started my first mission at 16 where I was selected to be in the team that was set out to assasinate the north korean president Kim Jong-un . We completed this mission but it did include some of our soldiers dead and heavily injured. On these other tabs on top, there will be a little more information about myself.
        Enjoy.</p>

   <div class="sectionOne">In the wake of the September 11 attacks, I had to lead a US Special Forces team into Korea for an extremely dangerous mission. Once there, me and my teammates developed an uneasy partnership with the Northern Alliance to take down the North korean soliders. Outgunned and outnumbered, me and my forces faced overwhelming odds in a fight against a ruthless enemy that didnt take prisoners.</div><!--sectionOne-->
