    <h3>Relevant implication #1: [Copyright and Intellecutual property]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p> Copyright intelluctual property is when we are using someone elses work. For instance, their words from websites, photos...etc. We need authorisation to use other peoples work. I used unsplash.com because it's a free website to download free photos of any kind without copyright. Unlike google images, we must ask for permission to download and use their photos. All my photos on my website are from unsplash.com. Unsplash.com is easier to use because we can just download photos, and no need to ask for permission or anything. It is more simple then asking for permission to use other peoples photos too. ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[ To address relevant implication, I used unsplash.com to download all my photos I used in my websites. I did'nt use any other websites such as google images because it is not copyright free.  ]</p>
