     <p>Hi, My name is Monty, and I'm 18 years of age. This picture next to me is me in the military. I had dropped out of school to join the military so that I could fight for my country. I have been recruited into the military when I was 15 and have been training since. I started my first mission at 16 where I was selected to be in the team that was set out to assassinate the North Korean president Kim Jong-un. I was known for the sniper with the most kills in the war history with a kill count of 1,000 kills. We completed this mission but it did include some of our soldiers dead and heavily injured. On these other tabs on top, there will be a little more information about myself.
        Enjoy.</p>

      <!--This section explains what had happened-->
   <div class="sectionOne">In the wake of the September 11 attacks, I had to lead a US Special Forces team into Korea for an extremely dangerous mission. Once there, I and my teammates developed an uneasy partnership with the Northern Alliance to take down the North Korean soldiers. Outgunned and outnumbered, I and my forces faced overwhelming odds in a fight against a ruthless enemy that didn't take prisoners. </div><!--sectionOne-->
