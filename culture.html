        <!--This explains my Tongan culture and my cultural background-->
   <div class="sectionOne"> I'm a full-blooded Tongan. I was born and raised in Tonga, Nukualofa but later on, moved to Nz when I was 5 years of age. In my Tongan culture, there are many traditional things we do. Tonga is a beautiful island to visit if you're going on a vacation. It has many beautiful islands to visit and the beaches are clean. One of the main reasons many visitors come to Tonga is to swim with humpback whales. They make their amazing 4,830km (3,000-mile) journey from their feeding grounds in the Antarctic to the warm waters of Tonga each year between June and October. They come to Tonga to breed, give birth, and raise their young before returning to the Antarctic. Tonga, officially the Kingdom of Tonga, Tongan Fakatuʿi ʿo Tonga, also called Friendly Islands, is a country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of some 170 islands divided into three main island groups: Tongatapu in the south, Haʿapai in the center, and Vavaʿu in the north. Isolated islands include Niuafoʿou, Niuatoputapu, and Tafahi (together known as the Niuatoputapu, or Niuas, island group) in the far north and ʿAta in the far south.
